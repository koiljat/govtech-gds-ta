Technical Assessment for GovTech, Government Digital Services, CC4.0 - Data Engineer

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up your project locally. This guide will help you to create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

    First, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/koiljat/govtech-gds-ta.git
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd govtech-gds-ta
    ```

    Create a virtual environment named `venv` (or any name you prefer):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    - On Windows:

      ```cmd
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

    With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies using:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command reads the `requirements.txt` file in your project directory and installs all the necessary Python packages.

### Running the Project

After setting up the virtual environment and installing the dependencies, you can run the project.
